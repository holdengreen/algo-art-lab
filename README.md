# Algorithmic Art & Graphics Rendering Lab
This is my CPU-accelerated graphics render project for creating and experimenting. It will be used to create media for me to display on my web accounts and on my website.

I am currently implementing a very cut-down rendering pipeline 

# Usage
run `./compile help`
